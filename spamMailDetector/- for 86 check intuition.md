- for 86 check intuition
    - test on normal images (unrelated to project)
- calibration set reductions
    - have model trainined on normal images then freexe
    - now have calibration set size:
        - keep reducing the size (all normal images)
        - keep testing on size 
            - test accuracy should start deviating
    - see how accuracy score changes
    - no more blurred images


- poster 1/3 to 1/4 about some background on waht conformal prediction is
- Topic: Limitation of Conformal Prediction
    - calibration set size
    - blurred images (out of distribution data)


- Analyze what happens when you have a new domain of data
    - do study of various ways you can fix conformal prediction for domain gaps
